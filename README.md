# Car_Rental_Application

Problem Statement: Car Rental Application

Objective:
Develop a scalable and secure Car Rental Application using Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, JUnit, and Spring Security to streamline the car rental process for both customers and administrators.

Background:
The car rental industry is growing, with an increasing demand for seamless, technology-driven solutions. Existing platforms often lack secure user authentication, real-time availability, and efficient booking management. This creates challenges for customers seeking convenience and for administrators managing vehicle inventory, bookings, and payments.

Proposed Solution:
Create a web-based Car Rental Application that allows customers to:

Browse available cars based on filters like location, date, and vehicle type.
Make secure bookings and payments.
Manage their bookings and review rental history.
For administrators, the system will provide tools to:

Add, update, or remove vehicle inventory.
Manage user accounts and bookings.
View analytical reports on rentals and revenues.
Key Functional Requirements:

User Management:

Secure user authentication and role-based access control using Spring Security.
Roles: Customer, Administrator.
Car Management:

Admins can manage the car inventory with attributes like availability, pricing, and specifications.
Booking System:

Customers can search and book cars, with automated availability checks using Hibernate.
Payment Integration:

Support secure payment processing.
Reports and Analytics:

Admins can generate reports for rental trends, user activity, and revenue.
Notifications:

Notify customers about booking confirmation, cancellations, or reminders.
Technologies and Tools:

Java Spring Boot: Backend application framework for rapid development.
Hibernate: ORM for managing database interactions.
MySQL: Relational database for storing user, vehicle, and booking data.
JUnit: For unit testing backend logic and ensuring code quality.
Spring Security: For implementing secure authentication and authorization.
Expected Outcome:
A robust and user-friendly car rental application that ensures secure and efficient handling of car rentals, enhancing customer experience and streamlining administrative operations.
